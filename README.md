# UniFile

An open source storage system for your data that storage in Filecoin/IPFS use [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage) which makes it easy to share them anywhere on the web.

## Introduction

UniFile is tightly scoped for the present and more broadly thought out for the future. Our primary objective is to create a best-in-class experience for uploading, collecting, and sharing media. 

In the future, we will adopt a decentralized incentive mechanism to encourage users to upload and use UniFile, and obtain a certain amount of Token income. And give Token more and more functions, such as decentralized governance, payment and other functions.
